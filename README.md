## TCPChat: Group Chat using TCP Server-Client Architecture

TCPChat is a command-line utility that allows communication between multiple clients through a TCP server. It recreates the functionality of the NetCat system command, providing a group chat experience where clients can connect to a server, send messages, and receive messages from other connected clients.

## Usage:

To start the TCP server, navigate to the server directory and run `go run main.go` or `./TCPChat`

To start a client, navigate to the client directory and run `nc localhost [port]`


### Server Configuration:
MaxConnections = 10
